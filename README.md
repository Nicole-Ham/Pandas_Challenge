# PyCitySchool Analysis

According to the data analysis of PyCity Schools, charter schools overall perform better. Most significanly in the percent overall passing with a 90% passing rate, whereas district schools have a 54% passing rate. When analysing overall percent passing rates, charter schools are in the top 5 and district schools are in the lowest 5 of overall performance. 

The charter schools are smaller in size and the data shows that smaller to medium-sized schools (under 2000 students) have better outcomes in math, reading, and overall scores. Larger schools (over 2000) fall behind by almost 24% in students that pass math. 

Surprisingly, more money spent on each student does not necessarily guarantee a higher passing rate. When over $645 is spent per student, all math, reading, and overall categories are the lowest compared to smaller spending ranges. According to the data, the best return on investment with students is in the range of $585 or less category - which happens to all be charter schools.
